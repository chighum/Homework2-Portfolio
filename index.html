          I was born and raised in Denver, CO as the middle of eight children in
          my family. Growing up I played a lot of sports, mainly focusing on
          soccer, lacrosse, and skiing. In 2015, I moved to Austin, TX to attend
          the University of Texas. While I was mainly focusing on my studies, I
          was also able to continue my competitive lacrosse career by joining
          the UT club lacrosse team. After graduating from UT in 2019 with a
          B.S. in Petroleum Engineering, I moved to Vail, CO in order to become
          a ski instructor. After two seasons of full time ski instructing and
          landscaping during the offseason, I recently moved back down to Denver
          in order to pursue a full-time, year-round career in web development.

          Aside from skiing, which is far and away my favorite hobby, I enjoy a
          variety of outdoor activities here in Colorado, including fishing,
          hiking, and camping. I'm a huge fan of all Denver sports, especially the 
          Broncos and Nuggets, and also enjoy watching Premier League and Champions 
          League European football. I am also an avid world traveler, and you can 
          see a collection of photos I have taken during my travels to places such 
          as Argentina, Thailand, and Italy on this page. Lastly, I greatly enjoy 
          listening to music, mostly the Grateful Dead but also Tedeschi Trucks Band, 
          Tyler Childers, Sturgill Simpson, and Mac Miller. While it will always make 
          me a little sad to have missed Jerry Garcia, my favorite activity today is
          attending Dead & Company concerts to hear the live music of the Dead.
